# Real-Time-Museum-Theft-Detection-with-computer-vision-using-STM32H747I-DISCO
To produce a real-time system that uses computer vision on an edge computing device to identify theft in museums around a bounded region. A trained algorithm is used to assess surveillance material locally in order to spot the exploitation of museum resources and alert the guards.
